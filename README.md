# gobo

## introduction

gobo is a small IRC parser & client framework, used to create IRC bots and the
like. It's also my first foray into Go, so don't be too rough on me. :)

I hope you find it useful.

## instructions

The repository is structured as libraries (irc/parser, irc/client) and a sample
bot that I'm gradually writing to do useful things that I need it to do
(qt_gerrit).
